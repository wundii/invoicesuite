## Status

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Project State
> This project is currently work in progress. The aim is for it to eventually replace the horstoeko/zugferd project with a modern codebase through legacy support and to support many more formats. This means there will be no official composer package until the official release. I would welcome input on both technical and subject-specific matters.

## Overview

InvoiceSuite is a multi-format library for electronic invoices with the goal of supporting as many formats and real-world variants as possible — from international standards to country-specific profiles. This includes German formats such as ZUGFeRD (and Factur-X, which is closely aligned with it) as well as XRechnung, with XRechnung explicitly supported in UBL syntax. The library also aims to cover interoperability ecosystems such as Peppol.

InvoiceSuite is designed to be extensible: if you follow the defined conventions and interfaces, you can add your own formats, profiles, or converters independently, without having to bend or modify the core.
