## Overview

InvoiceSuite is a multi-format library for electronic invoices with the goal of supporting as many formats and real-world variants as possible — from international standards to country-specific profiles. This includes German formats such as ZUGFeRD (and Factur-X, which is closely aligned with it) as well as XRechnung, with XRechnung explicitly supported in UBL syntax. The library also aims to cover interoperability ecosystems such as Peppol.

InvoiceSuite is designed to be extensible: if you follow the defined conventions and interfaces, you can add your own formats, profiles, or converters independently, without having to bend or modify the core.
